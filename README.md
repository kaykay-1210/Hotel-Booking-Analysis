# Hotel-Booking-Analysis

## Hotel Bookings Data Analysis

This repository contains code for analyzing hotel bookings data using Python libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly.

### Introduction
The dataset used in this analysis contains information about hotel bookings, including various attributes such as booking dates, hotel type, market segment, room type, pricing, and cancellation status.

### Data Preparation
We inspect the dataset to understand its structure and the presence of missing data. We also perform some data cleaning tasks such as handling missing values and standardizing categorical values.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset. This includes analyzing the geographical distribution of guests, market segments, and room pricing variations over time.

### Insights
- **Geographical Distribution**: We visualize the distribution of guests based on their countries of origin, providing insights into the top regions from which guests come.
- **Room Pricing**: We analyze the variation in room pricing over the year for different hotel types, providing insights into pricing trends.
- **Market Segment Analysis**: We analyze the distribution of bookings across different market segments to understand the main sources of bookings.
- **Cancellation Analysis**: We investigate the number of cancellations, identifying trends in cancellations over the year and by hotel type.

### Conclusion
Through this analysis, we gain valuable insights into hotel bookings data, including guest demographics, pricing trends, and booking patterns. These insights can be utilized by hotel management to optimize pricing strategies, marketing efforts, and customer experiences.
